# Android Learning Samples

A collection of samples for learning android development,

Best way to learn is by doing, This is my journey on learning android skills a day at a time, mostly self-taught, and use Kotlin in all my Android projects, I start this project for testing my skills and improving programme. The samples are all from internet and blog posts that others have done, I take it and just write by myself. Most of the projects I cannot finish it once I see the final output, so resorting to Google search and StackOverFlow to find a solution, and try my best to make them done, and after all I have uploaded and updated the projects to my Github account. If you have some questions please leave me a issue and Iâ€™ll appreciate it!
